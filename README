Project Description:
Vim plugin to moniter various system resources used by vim plugins in order
to effectively debug or determine the root of slowdowns, etc.

Error Conditions:
when it doesn't work (???)

Milestones:
Multi threaded support for non-blocking actions in vim
Message queue to pass information about CPU,etc utilization to proper
    data analysis processes
An analysis of proc files to gather the proper resource information

Expected Schedule/Timeline
Done by April 21

Language and operating system:
Python/VimL on Unix systems (our machines being Ubuntu 14.04 and OSX Yosemite)

Questions:
How low-level should we be working in? e.g. in the case of a message queue,
would we be implementing the actual message queue system or could we use
things like RabbitMQ or Celery?
